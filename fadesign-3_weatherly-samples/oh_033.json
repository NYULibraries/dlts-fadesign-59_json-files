Beck discusses his education and his family, including his work in\n              the Merchant Marine before entering college and his parents' involvement with the\n              Henry Street Settlement. He discusses his cooperative jobs while a student at Antioch\n              College in Ohio and the fact that these led to his interest in social work. He\n              describes the youth development programs at the Settlement and recounts the creation\n              and mission of Mobilization for Youth. He discusses Helen Hall, her philosophy of\n              social work, and her involvement in the creation of Mobilization for Youth. He\n              recounts a strike by Settlement staff in 1965 and the division this led to between the\n              Settlement, Mobilization for Youth, and other organizations in the LES. He describes\n              the differing approaches to social work between the Settlement and Mobilization for\n              Youth and the communities each served. He recounts becoming the Director at the\n              Settlement and issues he faced directing both the Settlement and Mobilization for\n              Youth. He compares his relationship with Helen Hall with her relationship with Lillian\n              Wald. Other topics include Beck's experiences on an unspecified New York City school\n              board and ethnic and racial tensions in the LES.

The interview is primarily with Nellie Dick and\n              her son, Jim Dick, occasionally participates. The majority of the interview covers\n              Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and\n              New Jersey. Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London\n              when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.\n              She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated\n              involvement in the anarchist community. Dick goes into detail about what she considers\n              to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the\n              belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure\n              of a community. She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to\n              learn. Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to\n              write the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eVoice of the Children\u003c/emph\u003e, a Stelton Colony\n              publication. As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and\n              carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for\n              the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings. She explains that\n              not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for\n              maintaining the grounds of the school. Dick describes teaching her students manners as\n              she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline. Dick expresses her adoration for\n              the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she\n              was a proponent of always improving the community. She also explains the colony's\n              mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom,\n              and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony. Dick explains that she knew she\n              belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there\n              should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an\n              education."

The\n              majority of this interview covers Mitch Miller's research on twentieth century\n              anarchism in New York, specifically in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan,\n              as well as in Europe. He discusses the decline of the Yiddish language, the Spanish\n              Civil War, and compares anarchism in the period between the 1950s and 1970s to\n              politics in the United States (US) at the time of the interview. Miller describes the\n              Lower East Side to be located below Fourteenth Street and East of Second Avenue. He\n              references the book, Fragments, written by Sam Dolgoff throughout his interview and\n              relates that Dolgoff played an active role in the anarchist movement during the\n              twentieth century in the Lower East Side (LES). Miller explains the tension between\n              various ethnic groups in the LES, including gang fights between Jewish, Irish, and\n              Italian residents and relates his opinion that between 1900 and 1940 neighborhoods\n              were the center of people's lives."

Rosen attended a Catholic\n              school on Henry Street until the fifth grade. After an evaluation at Bellevue Hospital\n              Center, Rosen was accepted into the Intellectually Gifted Children Program at Public\n              School 33 (PS33). As a young adult, he spent time at the Garden Cafeteria located in\n              the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan to engage in political discussions and\n              to read PM Newspaper. In 1948, the Rosens moved to the Brighton Beach neighborhood of\n              Brooklyn."

The majority of the\n              interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery. Shapiro recalls thousands of people\n              lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine.

Shapiro\n              explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery\n              in order to assist with bottling the wine. He suggests that, at the time of the\n              interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily\n              Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China. Shapiro argues that\n              people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby\n              and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.

She vividly describes the family's apartment on\n              Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the\n              building and a railroad style apartment. Weinstein discusses the fact that their\n              apartment was near her family's leather business. She discusses her friends' reactions\n              to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and the\n              neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan. Weinstein recalls visiting the\n              Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.\n              She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived\n              in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings. She expresses pride in\n              her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she\n              was about 30 years old to get married. Weinstein states that she enjoyed her\n              independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she\n              might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an\n              earlier age."

The\n                recording contains individual interviews with George Calvert, Mercedes Ortiz, and\n                Elizabeth \"Buffy\" Calvert. George Calvert's interview covers his work as a minister\n                in the East Harlem Protestant Parish. He recalls the early years of his seminary\n                field work in East Harlem and his involvement in the community's youth ministry as a\n                youth group administrator. He describes in detail a speaking tour of universities in\n                the southern United States in which he participated in February 1960. He recounts\n                preaching sermons and administering youth bible study groups of interracial groups\n                of students during the speaking tour.. Mercedes Ortiz's interview was conducted on\n                October 9 and October 22, 1995. She discusses her childhood in Puerto Rico and her\n                family's farm. Ortiz discusses her mother's management of the farm and describes the\n                process of making cheese. Ortiz describes her involvement in the Church of the Son\n                of Man and the fact that her knowledge of English and Spanish allows her to\n                contribute to the community through her translation of sermons. Throughout the\n                interview she stresses the importance of her faith and the fact that it provided her\n                with inner strength. Buffy Calvert recalls experiences during her teenage and early\n                adult years in which she fought racial and gender discrimination, including\n                supporting racial diversity within her sorority. She describes her desire to work in\n                a the religious ministry in New York City and explains her opinion that, racial\n                integration would only occur if white people voluntarily integrated primarily\n                African-American and Latino neighborhoods. She describes her experiences living in\n                East Harlem and and recalls enjoying its liveliness, culture, and honesty of its\n                residents. She discusses a summer volunteer, church work camp for college students\n                that she and her husband managed and recounts the first year of the camp. She\n                describes the Four Disciplines of the East Harlem Protestant Parish Group Ministry\n                which focus on religion, economics, politics, and social action. She explains her\n                opinion on the importance of finding balance between being a mother, a minister's\n                wife, and a community member which depends heavily upon faith and participation in\n                both the church and surrounding community."

The interview covers\n                Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his\n                experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister. Eddy describes New Britain,\n                Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the\n                immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century. He describes his\n                grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him. He describes his\n                experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance\n                driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East. He\n                compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam\n                War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences\n                of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war. He explains that\n                after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he\n                wanted for himself. He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling\n                throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different\n                religions. He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his\n                interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism. He explains how this\n                experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the\n                time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches. He recounts\n                taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945. He discusses\n                his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and\n                1948 and studying in New York City during the winters. He recounts enrolling full\n                time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant\n                Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949. He describes the sense of community he\n                witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern\n                European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood. He explains that while everyone\n                was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were\n                connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together. He discusses the\n                work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents\n                of the neighborhood had adequate housing. He discusses the ways in which public\n                housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them\n                to the tenements they replaced."

Wagner Archives at New York University in Manhattan, New\n                York. The majority of the interview covers Bernice Kaufman Nisinson's experiences as\n                a member of the Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) and her interest in political and\n                religious philosophies. She recalls the large selection of student run clubs at\n                James Madison High School in Brooklyn and the fact that she attended a meeting for\n                each club as a way to decide which ones she would like to join. Nisinson argues that\n                it is important to develop your own life philosophy. She spends a majority of her\n                interview discussing general socialist and Jewish beliefs including the importance\n                of education, the emphasis of family togetherness and carrying on traditions."

He recounts his\n              first experiences working as a longshoreman, including the type of work that was\n              available during the Great Depression and extortion of the new workers on the docks.\n              He discusses the formation of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local\n              1247. He discusses the work patterns on the docks, the formation of work gangs, and\n              pay rates for different types of cargo. He recounts becoming a foreman and the\n              difference in work for longshoreman and foremen. He lists the different ports in which\n              he worked: Hoboken, Jersey City, and Edgewater in New Jersey, and Staten Island and\n              Brooklyn in New York. He explains the ways in which information was disseminated about\n              which ports had work. Other topics include strikes and organized crime involvement in\n              the ILA and on the docks."
